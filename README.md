# Park City Hotel Website

Built a website for a fictional hotel in Park City, Utah with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript

## Project Description

I started this project with the goal of creating a website that required client-side form validation. From my prior experience working at Oracle in hospitality technology and being an avid skiier, I came up with the idea to apply this in a hotel booking form in Park City, Utah. I built this with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
  
A few areas of focus for this project include:   
- Client-side Form Validation with Vanilla JavaScript using Regex  
- Interaction with OpenWeatherAPI to display live local weather data
- Interaction with Google Maps API to display map of Park City  
- Animated Image Carousel using CSS and Vanilla JavaScript on a timer and with button selection 

### Website Workflow

The front page of the website will prompt the user to book a hotel stay at the hotel. The user has two options to book with the 'Book Now' element on the top left side and in the 'Book Now' button within the 'Make a Reservation' element. After selection, the user is taken to a second page with two options for rooms to select with respective 'Book Now' elements. Finally, the user is taken to the hotel booking form with client-side form validation.

### Project Status

As my original intent for this project was to focus on form validation, it has later evolved to it's current state with additional features and pages. Given this and it also being a fictional hotel, I have intentionally left placeholders for some of the text content. I am continuing to make additions to this website and may add full responsiveness in the near future.
